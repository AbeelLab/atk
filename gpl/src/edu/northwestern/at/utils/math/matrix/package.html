<p>
Methods for working with two-dimensional matrices
stored as arrays of doubles.  The code here is based in part on the following
existing matrix libraries for Java.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/">JAMA</a>,
       a public domain library from a cooperative venture by
       The MathWorks and the National Institute of Standards and Technology
       (NIST).
       </li>
   <li><a href="http://jmat.sourceforge.net/">JMAT</a>, a library
       by Yann Richet, licensed under the LGPL.
       </li>
   <li><a href="http://jmatrices.sourceforge.net/">JMatrices</a>,
       a library by Piyush Purang, licensed under the LGPL.
       In particular, the overall breakdown of package methods is modeled
       after the JMatrices implementation.
